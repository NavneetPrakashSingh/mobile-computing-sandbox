#### What does the app do?
Google trip is an ideal app for those who love to travel and is crucial for daily travelers. The app is eminent in terms of providing features like reservations, day plans, food options nearby, things to do in the city and much more. Moreover, all the features are available offline as well. It’s more like a journal for the places you have traveled so that if one day you want to remember what all you did in a trip, all you have to do is open the app and it will display you all the things you did in that particular journey. 

One of the highlights about the app is that it automatically picks up events from google calendar and Gmail so that the user doesn’t have to explicitly type in each journey detail. This auto-sync feature of the app highlights that the app was well planned before release. 

#### Why this application was chosen: 

The main reason why I choose this app dates back during my trip in India when I was looking for a good app that could show my reservation, itinerary, journey details instead of me downloading 3-4 apps to do this task. Whenever I had to refer to my daily schedule I would open the app and look at it or whenever I wanted to know any good restaurants near me this app came to the rescue. 

Another reason why I liked the app was that of the simple user design which makes it easy for users for any age groups to navigate between the app. Secondly, they provide a very aesthetic layout for the app. All the designs were well thought, and special details were added to the minor features of the app like automatically syncing trips from Gmail to the app. 

#### Why would someone use it: 

The primary reason why someone will use it is if they want to bring together their itinerary, reservations at one place, they should install this app. Moreover, if they want to explore a new city like famous restaurants around them or things to do around them like visiting public gardens or clock tower or visit the shopping mall, etc then this is an indispensable app for them. 

#### Technology leveraged: 

Location API: App uses GPS to track the location of the user to identify the current location and show nearby restaurants and things to do near user’s location. 

Network communication: Received data from the internet regarding a lot of features like download map of the place’s user visits, showing details of the nearby places, getting directions, reviews of the nearby place and many more. 

Account API: Since the app is displaying all the details related to reservations from Gmail account, its using account API to access, sign in and use that data to provide a customized screen to the user. 

System tools like measuring the app storage space during downloading of the app and downloading maps of the areas are also been accessed by the app. 
 

#### Application’s strength and weakness 
##### Strength: 
App provides a simple clean layout following Google's design patterns and guidelines and maintaining the right standard across the app. 
The app doesn’t contain any vulgar language and is available for users above 3+, hence, maintaining the language and speech standard across the app. 
Size of the app is less than 5MB (during installation), which shows the app doesn’t take much storage space in devices. <br />
It provides a powerful set of features like including an offline feature for the users because it expects users to be in an area where there is no internet connection. <br />
It provides nearby feature including food and restaurants, making it useful for the user to explore new areas is one of the best features available to users across apps with a similar theme. 

##### Weakness
Despite being a Google app, it doesn’t provide flexibility to integrate the app with google plus to share trips with other people. <br />
It lacks in many features which might be available in apps across the same category. <br />
Search doesn’t include a feature to use voice or image which majority of the apps from this category has. 

##### Suggested improvements 
Google trips stand out from the crowd in terms of its simple design and user experience, however, it does have many drawbacks and lacks some essential features. 
Initially, there isn’t an option to share trips with users from google plus or Facebook or Instagram.  
Secondly, it only displays bookings from Gmail, however, people using outlook, or any other service is not considered. 
Despite providing advanced search features its search is not very powerful. Voice recognition search or search using photos is not available to the users. 
Lastly, certain important features like uploading images related to the reservation are not available to the user is a major drawback and should be improved.

#### Meteor: Free Internet Speed & App Performance Test 
(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=meteor.test.and.grade.internet.connection.speed) 

##### What does the app do? 
Have you ever wondered that what might be the current internet connection speed on your mobile device? This app solves all those queries. Powered by a powerful interface, this app tells the current download speed, upload speed and ping time within seconds. It also tells how your internet connection performs against major internet consuming apps like WhatsApp, Facebook, etc. 
Moreover, you can store when and where your app was tested and shows the nearby ping locations. 

##### Why this application was chosen? 
The main reason why I choose this app is my obsession with checking the internet speed everywhere. It can be quite frustrating if you are trying to view a web page and it takes forever to load. In such cases, it’s helpful to diagnose where the issue lies and that’s where meteor comes handy. 
Moreover, the speed test results obtained via this app are expected results and not peak results and that’s where this app stands out as compared to other apps. Users can check their speed by measuring their router speed against the nearest ping location. 

##### Why would someone use it?
The primary reason why someone will use it is to check their internet connection speed. Further, if someone wants to know their nearest ping location or to check how much internet connection is being consumed by various apps installed on their mobile. 

##### Technology leveraged: 
Location API: App uses GPS to track the location of the user to identify the current location and show nearby ping locations to the user. 
Network communication: Basic features like ping, download, and upload happens with network communication, without an internet connection it does not do the speed test.  
Hardware controls: App controls vibrations making it easy for the user to know when the speed test is done. 
System tools like measuring the app storage space during downloading of the app and downloading maps of the areas are also been accessed by the app.  

##### Application’s strength and weakness 
###### Strength: 
The app does provide a powerful interface making it easy for the users to understand the app. It does follow Heuristics principles and design guidance. 
App responds quickly. Within seconds speed test is done and available to the users to view and analyze the data. 
App provides a history of tests done and quality against it which a lot of apps from the same category does not provide. 
App occupies less than 3MB on phone, which is a major advantage for users since it occupies very less space. 

###### Weakness 
Despite having a powerful user interface and design, it does lack in major features. It does not provide bandwidth and other technical details which other apps from the same category provide. 
Moreover, users cannot share their speed results with other users which other apps from the same category do provide. 
Although help is provided proper documentation is not available for the users to understand certain features for the app. 

##### Suggested improvements  
Meteor does stands away from the crowd in terms of user design and experience. However, many new features can be implemented like sharing results with other users, bandwidth implementation and many technical features were not available to the users. <br />
Secondly, some work must be done in their documentation and feedback section. Moreover, there wasn’t the proper way of displaying an error to the users. This can be overcome by providing proper documentation and proper way of displaying errors to the user.
